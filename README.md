# PV_Numbers
R Markdown document designed to interpret CT values for samples from a qPCR run and designate a result to each sample.

Main code is wrapped in a single executable chunk; ideally the code execution would be as painless as possible from inside the Markdown.

Takes a txt file as input containing sample IDs, well position, and CT values.
